# LLM-Guided Learning for Classical Machine Learning: A Novel Teacher-Student Framework

## Abstract

We propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as adaptive teachers to guide the learning process of classical machine learning algorithms. Unlike existing approaches that focus on reinforcement learning or optimization problems, our method applies natural language supervision to traditional algorithms such as Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). Through comprehensive experiments on both classification tasks (MNIST) and control tasks (robot navigation), we demonstrate that LLM guidance can significantly improve learning efficiency and final performance in specific domains. Our results show up to 16.7% performance improvement in robot control tasks, while revealing important task-dependent characteristics of LLM-guided learning. This work opens a new research direction by bridging classical machine learning with modern language models through natural language supervision.

## 1. Introduction

The landscape of machine learning has been dramatically transformed by the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, the integration of LLMs with classical machine learning algorithms remains largely unexplored. While LLMs excel at complex reasoning and natural language tasks, classical algorithms like Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) offer computational efficiency and interpretability that are crucial for resource-constrained environments and real-time applications.

Recent work has explored LLMs as policy teachers for reinforcement learning [Zhou et al., 2023] and as optimizers for various problems [Yang et al., 2023]. However, these approaches primarily focus on high-level instruction provision or numerical optimization, rather than detailed learning process guidance for classical algorithms. The potential of using LLMs as adaptive teachers that provide natural language feedback to guide classical machine learning algorithms remains untapped.

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework where LLMs serve as intelligent teachers that evaluate and guide the learning process of classical machine learning algorithms through natural language supervision. Our approach differs from existing work in several key aspects:

1. **Target Domain**: We focus on classical machine learning algorithms rather than reinforcement learning or optimization problems
2. **Supervision Method**: We employ detailed natural language evaluation and adaptive learning rate adjustment rather than high-level instructions
3. **Application Scope**: We demonstrate effectiveness across diverse tasks including classification and control systems

Our main contributions are:

- **Novel Framework**: Introduction of LLM-guided learning for classical machine learning algorithms
- **Empirical Validation**: Comprehensive experiments showing task-dependent effectiveness
- **Practical Implementation**: Open-source framework with reproducible results
- **Theoretical Insights**: Analysis of when and why LLM guidance is effective

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 LLMs as Teachers and Optimizers

Recent research has explored various ways to leverage LLMs for guiding other AI systems. Zhou et al. [2023] proposed using LLMs as policy teachers for training reinforcement learning agents, where the LLM provides high-level instructions to guide a smaller student agent. Yang et al. [2023] introduced the concept of using LLMs as optimizers, where optimization problems are described in natural language and solved iteratively.

However, these approaches differ significantly from our work. The policy teacher approach focuses on reinforcement learning with high-level instruction provision, while the optimizer approach targets general optimization problems with numerical feedback. Our work specifically addresses classical machine learning algorithms with detailed natural language supervision.

### 2.2 Classical Machine Learning Algorithms

Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), introduced by Huang et al. [2006], represent a class of single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks where hidden layer weights are randomly assigned and only output weights are learned. ELMs offer several advantages including fast learning speed, good generalization performance, and minimal human intervention. However, they also have limitations in terms of representation power and optimization capability compared to deep learning approaches.

Multi-layer ELMs (ML-ELM) have been developed to address some of these limitations by extending the ELM concept to multiple layers [Kasun et al., 2013]. Our work builds upon these classical approaches by introducing LLM guidance to enhance their learning capabilities.

### 2.3 Teacher-Student Learning

Teacher-student learning frameworks have been widely studied in machine learning, particularly in the context of knowledge distillation [Hinton et al., 2015]. Traditional approaches typically involve a larger, more complex teacher model guiding a smaller student model through soft targets or intermediate representations.

Our approach differs by using an LLM as the teacher that provides natural language feedback rather than numerical targets, and by focusing on classical algorithms rather than neural networks.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Framework Overview

Our LLM-guided learning framework consists of three main components:

1. **Student Algorithm**: A classical machine learning algorithm (e.g., ELM)
2. **LLM Teacher**: A large language model that evaluates performance and provides guidance
3. **Environment**: The task environment that provides feedback and evaluation metrics

The learning process follows an iterative cycle where the student algorithm performs a task, the LLM teacher evaluates the performance using natural language reasoning, and the student algorithm updates its parameters based on the teacher's guidance.

### 3.2 LLM Teacher Design

The LLM teacher is designed to provide detailed, contextual evaluation of the student algorithm's performance. Unlike traditional reward functions that provide scalar feedback, our LLM teacher offers rich, natural language descriptions that capture multiple aspects of performance.

#### 3.2.1 Evaluation Prompt Template

```
Task: {task_description}
Current State: {state_description}
Action Taken: {action_description}
Result: {result_description}

Please evaluate this performance considering:
1. Task completion effectiveness
2. Efficiency and resource usage
3. Safety and constraint satisfaction
4. Areas for improvement

Provide a score from 0.0 to 1.0 and detailed feedback.
```

#### 3.2.2 Adaptive Learning Rate Adjustment

Based on the LLM's evaluation, we implement adaptive learning rate adjustment:

```python
def adjust_learning_rate(base_lr, llm_score, improvement_trend):
    if llm_score > 0.8:
        return base_lr * 0.5  # Reduce for fine-tuning
    elif llm_score < 0.3:
        return base_lr * 2.0  # Increase for exploration
    else:
        return base_lr  # Maintain current rate
```

### 3.3 Student Algorithm Implementation

We implement two variants of classical algorithms:

#### 3.3.1 Traditional ELM

The traditional ELM follows the standard formulation:
- Hidden layer weights are randomly initialized and fixed
- Only output layer weights are learned through least squares optimization
- Learning is fast but limited by fixed hidden representations

#### 3.3.2 Activation Function Reversed ELM

Inspired by recent work on alternative learning approaches, we implement a variant where activation functions are applied before weight multiplication:

```python
def forward_pass_reversed(self, x):
    activated_input = self.activation(x)
    hidden_output = np.dot(activated_input, self.input_weights)
    return self.activation(hidden_output)
```

This approach allows for different learning dynamics and potentially better adaptation to LLM guidance.

1. Traditional ELM without guidance
2. Activation function reversed ELM without guidance
3. Random feedback (control condition)

- Shows improvement over unguided version
- But still underperforms compared to traditional ELM
- Suggests the base algorithm quality affects guidance effectiveness

This hybrid approach may be particularly valuable for resource-constrained environments where classical algorithms are preferred but can benefit from intelligent guidance.
