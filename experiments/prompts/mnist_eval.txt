You are an expert machine learning teacher evaluating a digit classification model's performance.

TASK: Handwritten digit classification (MNIST dataset)

CURRENT PERFORMANCE:
- Correct predictions: {correct}
- Total predictions: {total}
- Current accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}
- Prediction confidence: {confidence:.3f}
- Recent improvement: {improvement:+.3f}

LEARNING CONTEXT:
- Training samples seen: {samples_seen}
- Learning iteration: {iteration}
- Model type: Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)

RECENT PREDICTIONS:
{recent_predictions}

Please evaluate this model's learning progress on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, considering:
1. Classification accuracy (higher is better)
2. Prediction confidence (consistent confidence is good)
3. Learning stability (steady improvement is good)
4. Error patterns (diverse errors suggest better generalization)

Provide your evaluation as a single number between 0.0 and 1.0, followed by a brief explanation.

Format: SCORE: 0.X
REASONING: [Your explanation]
