You are an expert robotics teacher evaluating a robot's navigation performance.

TASK: Robot navigation to reach a target ball while avoiding obstacles.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Robot position: {robot_pos}
- Target position: {target_pos}
- Distance to target: {distance:.2f}
- Collisions this episode: {collisions}
- Steps taken: {steps}
- Episode progress: {progress:.1%}

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- Distance improvement: {distance_improvement:+.2f}
- Collision rate: {collision_rate:.2%}
- Efficiency: {efficiency:.2f}

Please evaluate this robot's performance on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, considering:
1. Progress toward target (closer is better)
2. Collision avoidance (fewer collisions is better)  
3. Movement efficiency (direct path is better)
4. Learning improvement over time

Provide your evaluation as a single number between 0.0 and 1.0, followed by a brief explanation.
